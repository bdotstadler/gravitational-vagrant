# Images for libvirt are stored here locally for fedora 26 workstation
/var/lib/libvirt/images/

# Vagrant images are not destroyed with the destroy command.  Use the following command to remove images.
vagrant box remove

# Networking.  By default it appears libvirt is assigning networking resources using an internal schema
# on the localhost and NOT my networks DHCP service.  From the VM I can access external network resources.
# Some internal VM NATing must be occuring.  Will want to change this so VMs are fully accessible via network.

# Access to local VM can be done using the vagrant SSH command.  Will explore later how this works with multiple VMs.
vagrant ssh
