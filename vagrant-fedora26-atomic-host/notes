#####QUICK BRING UP#####
# Run the following to quickly bring up a fedora 26 atomic host image.
# This image under consideration for running Kubernetes.

# Create a default config for fedora 26 atomic host.  Config can be modded later.
vagrant init fedora/26-atomic-host

# Bring up the instace defined in the vagrant file.
vagrant up 

# destroy the instance
vagrant destroy


#####IMAGES#####
# Attempt to store this box for later use failed.  Unknown why.  Investigate later
# It does appear the image file is not downloaded again after the destroy process is complete.
  vagrant box add fedora/26-atmoic-host

# Images for libvirt are stored here locally for fedora 26 workstation
  /var/lib/libvirt/images/

# Vagrant images are not destroyed with the destroy command.  Use the following command to remove images.
  vagrant box remove


#####NETWORKING#####
# By default it appears libvirt is assigning networking resources using an internal schema
# on the localhost and NOT my networks DHCP service.  From the VM I can access external network resources.
# Some internal VM NATing must be occuring.  Will want to change this so VMs are fully accessible via network.
#
# OK yes, there are different networking schemes vagrant can use, default, private - appears to be default - and public.
#
# Caveat,boxes are not secure by default since vagrant has certain expectations for access to these devices.  Careful
# when using public networking.  See section security.

# SSH:
# Access to local VM can be done using the vagrant SSH command.  Will explore later how this works with multiple VMs.
  vagrant ssh

#####SECURITY#####
# Warning:  Vagrant images are very insecure by default.  Use care when exposing to the network. Else spin own image.
# Default root password is 'vagrant'.
# Default vagrant password is 'vagrant'.
# Vagrant user also accepts key based SSH authentication.  This allows for the vagrant ssh command to function.  This
# is a default key across ALL images supported by vagrant.
# Passwordless sudo.


#####FOLDER SYNC#####
# By default one folder is synced.  This is the default project folder with /home/vagrant/sync.  It appears current
# Vagrant documentation is incorrect.
